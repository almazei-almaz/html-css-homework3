            Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes
            it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A
            blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is
            duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer
            systems on the blockchain.

            Let's start with the definitions: a startup is a company in usually the first stages of its development that wants to scale up quickly. Startups are often young, innovative, collaborative, and focused on growth, while corporations are often established, slow-moving, hierarchical, and focused on productivity.
            But there could be exceptions to the rules, of course! Some corporate companies operate more like startups and can offer more flexibility and influence on decisions, while some larger startups can provide more stability and structure. Make sure to do some research about the company culture and ask questions during the interview process to understand how they operate.
